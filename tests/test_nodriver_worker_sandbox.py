"""Cover the nodriver worker's browser-startup orchestration.

`_fetch_html` runs in the *child* process and owns the sequence that brings a
browser up: pick a port, launch Chromium, wait for its DevTools endpoint,
connect nodriver to it, retry a transient failure, terminate the process of any
attempt that failed, and remove the temporary profile directory on the way out.
Those claims are about *sequencing and cleanup*, so no resolver test can make
them -- they stay at this layer permanently. The flag and default decisions that
used to be asserted here moved to
:mod:`tests.test_nodriver_worker_launch_resolvers`; nothing in this module should
assert one again.

**Every double is built with autospec**, from the real callable. That is the
whole point of this module's rewrite: the previous version patched each
collaborator with a bare ``AsyncMock``, which accepts any arguments at all, and
that is exactly why giving `_fetch_html` five new required keyword-only
arguments disabled eight tests at once without one of them objecting. An
autospec double raises :class:`TypeError` on a wrong-arity call, so the next
signature change fails here rather than passing.

Two details of that, both measured. Autospec of an ``async def`` runs its
signature check *inside* the coroutine body, so the check fires only when the
call is awaited -- fine for `_fetch_html`, which awaits all of them, but a
future assertion-only test would get no check at all. And the
`_terminate_process` call inside `_cleanup` sits under ``except Exception:
pass``, so a :class:`TypeError` raised there is swallowed: those tests still
fail, on the terminated-process comparison, but not with the signature error
that caused it.

**One double is weaker than the rest, and it is worth knowing which.**
:func:`nodriver.start` ends in ``**kwargs``, so its autospec accepts any keyword
at all -- measured. It catches surplus *positional* arguments and nothing else.
A nodriver release that renamed ``browser_executable_path`` would slip past this
module and fail only against a real browser. The three internal collaborators
(`_launch_chromium`, `_wait_for_devtools_ready`, `_terminate_process`) have no
``**kwargs`` and are fully checked.

**The real `nodriver` package is used, with only `nodriver.start` patched.** The
previous version installed a stand-in module built with
``type("X", (), {"start": ...})``. That could never have worked even with the
signature repaired: `_fetch_html` executes ``cdp = uc.cdp`` immediately after
importing, before any branch, and the stand-in has no ``cdp``. `nodriver` is an
unconditional runtime dependency of this project, so the real module is always
importable and there is nothing to gain by faking it.

Nothing here starts a browser, a subprocess or a socket, and every environment
variable `_fetch_html` reads is pinned -- including ``KINDLY_USER_AGENT``, whose
absence sends `_resolve_user_agent` into `_detect_chrome_version`, which runs
``<browser> --version`` as a real subprocess.

    call. Everything else inside `_fetch_html` runs for real, which is the
    point: the orchestration is the subject.

    Every double is created with ``autospec=True``, so a call with the wrong
    arity raises :class:`TypeError` inside the code under test rather than being
    silently recorded. That is the property this whole module exists to restore.

    The real :class:`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` still runs; it is only wrapped

    would make the profile-cleanup case assert against itself.

    ``asyncio.sleep`` is deliberately **not** patched here. The retry backoff is
    driven to zero through ``KINDLY_NODRIVER_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS``, a real
    seam; patching :func:`asyncio.sleep` would replace it on the global module
    for the duration and reach far past the code under test. Driving it to zero
    does **not** exercise the backoff arithmetic -- zero times anything is zero,
    and gutting the expression survives every case that uses this default. The
    one case that asserts the arithmetic patches :func:`asyncio.sleep` for

    The other sleep that remains is the fixed 100 ms `_cleanup` waits for
    Chromium to flush profile writes before the profile directory is removed.

    case; the rest pay it without observing it.

    :func:`shutil.which` is pinned to "nothing installed" even though four of
